I will use this page to keep track of what I've added and where I got stuck 


5/17/22
    - Created a Card component that adapts itself to the data passed into it 
    -Several bad optimization require a more trained eye to iron out 
        -Links are causing an issue as where no links are passed thing are undefined. (need some for of conditional)
    -Another set back the fucking StartsWith doesnt seem to exist on this version of Gatsby a workaround is needed --Fixed

5/18/22 
    -Spoke with Arjun and got a better understanding of what my components are supposed to do so I redid the Card component --Fixed



5/19/22 
    -Tutoring with Arjun refactored card and links into the same component and a bunch of useful tips where aquired (:



TODO 
   -Figure out why the video loop breaks 
   -Start adding new icons and add content to eachpage other than placeholder 







Theo codes full time stuff I wanna add:

    -Redo nav menu to look cooler and more inline with the aesthetics --In progress

    -Change linkOrbs so that they make sense to use such as showing more info when hovered to reveal more info
        -current approach for favicon is to store them locally and then call them in the actual component
        need arjun for clarity 



    -add Effect to the title page h1 -- added :D 

    -add some comments to clear up some of the more confusing aspects of the site's code -- inprogress


    


Design ideas **Arjun needed 
    -Space could render a different video based on the page to keep it cool and unique 
    -Id like the nav to turn into three directions bottom left and right
        -and when clicked the screen is animated in that direction and shows the new video/zone
    -maybe move the ring based on which page you are
