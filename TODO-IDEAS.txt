I will use this page to keep track of what I've added and where I got stuck 


5/17/22
    - Created a Card component that adapts itself to the data passed into it 
    -Several bad optimization require a more trained eye to iron out 
        -Links are causing an issue as where no links are passed thing are undefined. (need some for of conditional)
    -Another set back the fucking StartsWith doesnt seem to exist on this version of Gatsby a workaround is needed --Fixed

5/18/22 
    -Spoke with Arjun and got a better understanding of what my components are supposed to do so I redid the Card component --Fixed



5/19/22 
    -Tutoring with Arjun refactored card and links into the same component and a bunch of useful tips where aquired (:
